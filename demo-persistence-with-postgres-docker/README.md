# Storage Persistence with Postgres (PostgreSQL) using REX-Ray

Recovering tables! 

This scenario is not going to use an orchestrator and demonstrates the ability to do manual recovery.

### Prerequisites

- A multi-node computing environment with a storage platform that is compatible with [REX-Ray](https://github.com/emccode/rexray). [Examples](https://github.com/codedellemc/demo#environment-quickstarts)
- [REX-Ray must be installed](http://rexray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on each node and [configured with the preemption flag](http://libstorage.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/config/#volume-configuration)
- Docker 1.12+ must be installed on each node

### Pre-Create Volumes

Examine the [Dockerfile used for Postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) and look at the `VOLUME` line. This represents the volume necessary to persist data:
```
VOLUME /var/lib/postgresql/data
```

Only one path is necessary for this particular database. Two options can be used to create the volumes. From the terminal session of any host, choose one of the following (`size` is an optional parameter):

1. Docker Volume 

  ```
$ docker volume create -d rexray --name pg_data --opt=size=8
  ```

2. REX-Ray CLI
  ```
$ sudo rexray volume create pg_data --size=8
  ```

All hosts will have access to this volume.
```
$ docker volume ls
$ docker volume inspect pg_data
```

### Start the Container
Docker 1.12+ has the ability to use `docker service create` which takes advantage of Swarm orchestration and networking. This demonstration will use `docker run` which is simply running a container without any additional features.

On the first host, start and run the container:
```
$ docker run -dit --name pg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword --volume-driver=rexray -v pg_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres
```

View the logs of the server:
```
$ docker logs pg
```

The logs will finish with `LOG:  autovacuum launcher started`. The server has completed its initial setup and is ready to accept incoming connections.

**NOTE:** If this demo is in front of an audience, download the docker image on all hosts prior to presenting:
```
$ docker pull postgres
```

### Add a new database
Using `docker exec`, go into the container and add a new database

```
$ docker exec -it pg sh
# su - postgres
# psql
# CREATE DATABASE rexray;
# \l
```

### Stop and remove the container
Exit out of the container using `ctrl+p ctrl+q` to keep the TTY session alive.

Display all running containers:
```
$ docker ps
```

Stop the container:
```
$ docker stop pg
```

Display all containers, running or stopped:
```
$ docker ps -a
```

Remove the container:
```
$ docker rm pg
```

Verify all containers are removed:
```
$ docker ps -a
```

At this point, there is no trace of a container that existed that ran our Postgres image. Containers are an ephemeral technology and their nature to be disposable.

### Start a container on a different host

On a different host that also has access to the storage platform, use the same command as before:
```
$ docker run -dit --name pg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword --volume-driver=rexray -v pg_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres
```

View the logs to see a much more truncated set up time since the persisted volume contains all the data.
```
$ docker logs pg
```

Verify the newly created database still exists:
```
$ docker exec -it pg sh
# su - postgres
# psql
# \l
```
